# Kotlin_Intro
First Kotlin project.

Note: I am leaving out DI & Rx to learn the core fundementals. Once the project is complete I will add DI &Rx as needed. 

## Goal 
- Get a solid understanding of Kotlin (note: so far it is amazing and I wish I converted earlier)
- Using Kotlin and MVVM archecture to build a News application retreiving RSS feeds from news sites.  
- Unit Test in Kotlin

Kotlin Stages:
- ~~Retrofit, Http3, and custom LiveLib (Will be converting this to Kotlin as well) for Network connections..~~
  - Unit Test with Kotlin
- ~~Room database~~
  - Unit Test with Kotlin
- UI and Data Handling (data binding with Arch Components)
  - ViewModels, Fragmentation, RecyclerAdapters...
